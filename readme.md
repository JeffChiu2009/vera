An artificial intelligence system to determine if a given statement is true or false.

Nowadays, information is more accessible than ever. Often, people are surrounded with information from a million different sources, each claiming something or another. Along with these unstable times in our country, we determined that there should be a way to check the validity of a statement.

At LAHacks 2017, we built an artificial intelligence system that uses machine learning from the Microsoft Cognitive Services to help determine whether a given statement is true or false.
